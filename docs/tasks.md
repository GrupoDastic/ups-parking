# UPS Parking Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the UPS Parking application. Each task is designed to enhance the codebase's quality, maintainability, and user experience.

## Architecture and Structure

1. [ ] Implement a consistent folder structure for components (e.g., organize by feature rather than by type)
2. [ ] Create a state management strategy document to clarify when to use React Query vs. local state
3. [ ] Implement proper error boundary components to gracefully handle runtime errors
4. [ ] Extract hardcoded strings into a localization system for future multi-language support
5. [ ] Create a proper environment configuration system with validation for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
6. [ ] Implement a logging system for better debugging and monitoring
7. [ ] Create a standardized API response handling layer to centralize error handling

## Code Quality

8. [ ] Implement ESLint with a comprehensive ruleset to enforce code style and catch potential issues
9. [ ] Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
10. [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode and fix resulting type errors
11. [x] Remove console.log statements and implement proper logging
12. [x] Fix the commented-out code in parkingService.ts (getParkingAvailable function)
13. [x] Refactor complex conditional rendering in components (e.g., DynamicAreaBlock.tsx)
14. [ ] Standardize the use of styling approaches (choose between inline styles, StyleSheet, and Tailwind)
15. [ ] Add proper JSDoc comments to functions and components
16. [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality checks

## Testing

17. [ ] Set up a testing strategy document outlining approach and coverage goals
18. [ ] Implement unit tests for utility functions and services
19. [ ] Add component tests for key UI components
20. [ ] Implement integration tests for critical user flows
21. [ ] Set up E2E testing with Detox or similar tool
22. [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically
23. [ ] Add test coverage reporting
24. [ ] Create mock services for testing API-dependent components

## Performance

25. [ ] Implement proper React memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
26. [ ] Optimize SVG rendering in DynamicAreaBlock component
27. [ ] Add virtualization for long lists to improve performance
28. [ ] Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
29. [ ] Optimize image assets (compression, proper sizing)
30. [ ] Implement proper caching strategy for API responses
31. [ ] Profile and optimize app startup time
32. [ ] Implement code splitting for better initial load time

## User Experience

33. [ ] Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
34. [ ] Add proper loading indicators for all async operations
35. [ ] Implement proper form validation with user-friendly error messages
36. [ ] Create a consistent design system (colors, spacing, typography)
37. [ ] Improve the speech recognition feedback mechanism
38. [ ] Add haptic feedback for important interactions
39. [ ] Implement proper navigation transitions
40. [ ] Add pull-to-refresh functionality consistently across the app

## Accessibility

41. [ ] Add proper accessibility labels to all interactive elements
42. [ ] Ensure proper color contrast for all text
43. [ ] Implement screen reader support

48. [ ] Add alternative text for all images

## Documentation

49. [ ] Expand README.md with proper setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
50. [ ] Create component documentation with Storybook or similar tool
51. [ ] Document API integration points
52. [ ] Create user flow diagrams
53. [ ] Document state management approach
54. [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
